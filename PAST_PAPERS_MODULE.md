  fileUrl: String (required),
  originalFileName: String,

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### File Upload
- **Local Development**: Files stored in `server/uploads/pastPapers/`
- **Vercel Deployment**: Files would need Cloudinary or similar service (currently accepts fileUrl in API)

### Favorites Storage
- Uses browser `localStorage`
- Key: `pastPapersFavorites`
- Stores array of paper IDs

### Performance
- MongoDB indexes on `subject` and `year`
- Client-side filtering for instant search
- Lazy loading for large paper lists
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Papers Not Showing
1. Check MongoDB connection
2. Verify API endpoints are working (`/api/pastPapers`)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify authentication token is present

### Upload Failing
1. Check file size (max 20MB)
2. Verify file type (PDF or image)
3. Check server uploads directory exists
4. Verify admin authentication

### Viewer Not Loading
1. Check file URL is correct
2. Verify CORS settings
3. Check file exists on server
4. Verify file type is supported

## 🚀 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

As suggested in the requirements, consider adding:
1. **Notification System**: Notify students of new papers
2. **Download Restrictions**: Watermarked previews
3. **Analytics**: Track paper views by subject
4. **Pagination**: For better performance with many papers
5. **Cloud Storage**: Integrate Cloudinary for production
6. **Framer Motion**: Install and use for advanced animations

## 📝 Notes

- The module is fully functional and ready to use
- All components are responsive and accessible
- Dark mode is fully integrated
- File uploads work in local development
- For Vercel deployment, consider using Cloudinary for file storage
